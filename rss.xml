      <description>Testosterone is the key hormone needed for a healthy man. With age it is normal for testosterone production to decline in the body, but when it is running low it can throw certain functions off balance. Testosterone is needed for healthy muscles, bone strength, and for a strong libido. We specialize in treating “Low T” (low testosterone) to restore your well being and quality of life as a man. What is Testosterone?</description>

      <description>What is IV Infusion Therapy? Intravenous or IV infusion therapy refers to the slow infusion of a nutrients and other compounds which are administered directly into your blood stream via the vein.  By intravenously injecting the nutrients and medication, the digestive system is bypassed, which provides for a very effective delivery method.  The IV administration allows for faster absorption of the medication and avoids losses in the digestive system that occur when the same nutrient and medication are ingested orally.</description>
